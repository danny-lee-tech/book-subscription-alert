Based on the content at the bottom, output a summary with the following template:

Company: %s
Book: <Book Name> by <Author>
Price: <Price>
Early Access Date: <Date/Time in EST of Early Access Sale>
General Access Date: <Date/Time in EST of General Population Sale>
URL: %s

The above information should be populated with just the US-related information (not UK or Canada).

Also, generate a google calendar link (text only) that uses the /calendar/render API to create an event.  The event date should be the date/time of the early access sale in EST and the event description should have the same summary from earlier.
